        <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
        <p>
          Automated test execution is often complex and inaccessible to non-technical users. 
          This project creates a Spring Boot dashboard that acts as a user-friendly interface. 
          It allows anyone to trigger Selenium test runs via GitHub Actions with a single click and 
          view detailed results and logs in a centralized location. 
        </p>
      <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
      <p>
        The core of this project is a Spring Boot application that serves as a dashboard for a 
        Selenium automation suite. The automation scripts are written in Java using the TestNG 
        framework and are hosted in a GitHub repository. A GitHub Actions workflow is set up to 
        automatically run the tests on every code push to the main branch. The Spring Boot application, 
        when deployed, provides a clean and simple user interface (UI) to view the historical test 
        results and, most importantly, to manually trigger a new test run with a single click. 
        This creates a powerful feedback loop, allowing anyone on the team to initiate tests and 
        view their outcomes without needing to interact with the command line or the GitHub 
        Actions interface directly.
      </p>
      <h3>Project Detailed Explanation:</h3>
     
      <p><span class="sub-title-para">
        Selenium Test Automation Suite: </span>This is the heart of the project. It's a standard 
        Maven-based Java project using Selenium WebDriver for browser automation and TestNG for 
        test management, assertions, and reporting. The tests are structured using a Page Object 
        Model (POM) for maintainability and reusability. It includes an testng.xml file to 
        Sdefine and group tests.
      </p>
   
      <p><span class="sub-title-para">
        GitHub Actions Workflow:</span> A .github/workflows/maven.yml file is configured in the repository. 
        This YAML file defines a CI/CD pipeline. It specifies that on every push to the main branch, 
        a job should run that checks out the code, sets up the Java environment, and executes the 
        TestNG tests using a Maven command (mvn test).
      </p>

      <p><span class="sub-title-para">
        Spring Boot Dashboard Application:</span> This is a separate, lightweight Spring Boot application. 
        It's built as a web application (using a template engine like Thymeleaf or a front-end with HTML and CSS). 
        It has a controller that handles HTTP requests.</br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="sub-title-para">Dashboard View:</span> The main page of the application displays a list of past test runs. 
        It fetches this data, including run status (pass/fail), execution time, and a link to the detailed report, 
        by interacting with the GitHub Actions API or by reading a local data store.</br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="sub-title-para">
        Trigger Mechanism:</span> The application exposes a REST endpoint or a simple web form with a button. 
        When a user clicks "Run Tests," the application makes a request to the GitHub Actions API to trigger a 
        new workflow dispatch. This is the key feature that allows the Spring Boot app to kick off the 
        automation run in the cloud.</br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="sub-title-para">
        Results and Logs Integration:</span> The Spring Boot app can either store and display the results directly or, 
        more efficiently, act as a proxy. After a test run is complete on GitHub Actions, the workflow can 
        publish the test report (e.g.,Extent reports) as a build artifact. The Spring Boot application then 
        provides links to these artifacts or uses a background job to download and parse them to display 
        key metrics (total tests, passed, failed, skipped) and detailed logs on its dashboard
      </p>
    

      

      <h3>Showcase and Demonstrative Value:</h3>

      <h6>This project provides a powerful and practical demonstration of several core skills:</h6>
     
      <p><span class="sub-title-para">
        Software Development: </span>It showcases the ability to build a robust, standalone web 
        application using the Spring Boot framework, complete with a clean UI, RESTful endpoints, 
        and backend logic.
      </p>
   
      <p><span class="sub-title-para">
        Test Automation:</span> It proves proficiency in writing and maintaining a 
        professional-grade Selenium test suite using the industry-standard Java and TestNG stack. 
      </p>

      <p><span class="sub-title-para">
        CI/CD:</span> The integration with GitHub Actions is a clear indication of a solid 
        understanding of modern DevOps practices. The ability to automate builds, tests, and deployments 
        shows a grasp of continuous integration principles.</br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="sub-title-para">API Integration:</span> 
        The project requires using GitHub's REST API to programmatically trigger a workflow, 
        which is a key skill for integrating different services and tools.</br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="sub-title-para">Problem-Solving:</span> 
        This project demonstrates the ability to solve a real-world problem: making an automated 
        test suite accessible to non-technical stakeholders (e.g., project managers, business analysts) 
        without them needing to know how to run a Git command or navigate a CI/CD tool. The UI 
        abstracts away the underlying complexity, providing a simple, powerful interface.</br>
